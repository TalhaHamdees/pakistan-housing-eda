Review the project progress:

1. Read `PROGRESS.md` for completion status
2. If a session number ($ARGUMENTS) is provided, review that specific session's work:
   - Open the notebook and check the code written in that session
   - Verify all markdown narrative cells are present and well-written
   - Check chart quality (titles, labels, sizing)
   - Identify anything that could be improved
3. If no session number, give an overall project status:
   - Sessions completed vs remaining
   - Code quality assessment
   - Notebook flow and narrative quality
   - Suggest what to work on next

Be constructive — highlight what's good AND what could be better.
